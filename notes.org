** Bernstein's inequality
*** Introduce problem
**** DONE Tail bound for infinity norm of iid sum of high-dimensional vectors
**** DONE Applications?
**** DONE Assume variance and a.s. bounds
**** DONE No assumption on dependence between coordinates
*** Main result: maximal Bernstein tail bound
**** DONE State this way for ease of use -- constants on left not right
**** DONE Subgaussian part
**** DONE Subexponential part
**** DONE Tightened even further with Bennett but only up to logs
