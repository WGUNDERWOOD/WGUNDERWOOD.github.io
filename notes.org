** Bernstein's inequality
*** Introduce problem
**** Tail bound for infinity norm of iid sum of high-dimensional vectors
**** Applications?
**** Assume variance and a.s. bounds
**** No assumption on dependence between coordinates
*** Main result: maximal Bernstein tail bound
**** State this way for ease of use -- constants on left not right
**** Subgaussian part
**** Subexponential part
**** Tightened even further with Bennett but only up to logs
*** Examples
**** Bernoulli(p)
***** CLT and union bound
***** Check Bernstein agrees
**** Bernoulli(p/n)
***** Weak convergence to Poisson
***** Check Bernstein agrees
**** Kernel estimator?
