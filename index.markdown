## Biography

Originally from the UK,
I obtained my MMath in Mathematics & Statistics from the
[Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/)
at the
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).
I was supervised there by
[Mihai Cucuringu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GFvVRzwAAAAJ&hl=en),
and wrote my master's dissertation on
*Motif-Based Spectral Clustering of
Weighted Directed Networks*.
I am an alumnus of
[St John's College](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/).

## Software

I am an author of the
[motifcluster]()
TODO update link
package for motif-based spectral clustering of weighted directed networks,
available in R and Python.

All of my software projects can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/WGUNDERWOOD).
