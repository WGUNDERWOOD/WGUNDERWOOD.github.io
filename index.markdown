<h2> About </h2>

I am a PhD candidate in the
<a href="https://orfe.princeton.edu/">Operations Research & Financial Engineering</a>
department at
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>,
where my research interests include mathematical statistics
and probability theory.
Currently I am working with my advisor
<a href="https://cattaneo.princeton.edu">Matias Cattaneo</a>
on using strong approximation theory
to develop provably robust inference procedures
for nonparametric estimators.
