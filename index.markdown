I am a PhD candidate in the
[Operations Research & Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/)
department at Princeton University, where
my research interests include stochastic analysis, probability and mathematical statistics.

Previously I obtained my MMath in Mathematics & Statistics from the
[Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/)
at the University of Oxford, where I was supervised by
[Professor Mihai Cucuringu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GFvVRzwAAAAJ&hl=en).
My master's dissertation was on Motif-Based Spectral Clustering of
Weighted Directed Networks.
