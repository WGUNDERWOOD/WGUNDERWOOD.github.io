I am a PhD candidate in the
[Operations Research & Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/)
department at
[Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/),
where my research interests include mathematical statistics
and probability theory.
Currently I am working with my advisor
[Matias Cattaneo](https://cattaneo.princeton.edu)
on using strong approximation theory
to develop provably robust inference procedures
for nonparametric estimators.

## Biography

I obtained my MMath in Mathematics & Statistics from the
[Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/)
at the
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).
I was supervised there by
[Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/),
and wrote my master's dissertation on
*Motif-Based Spectral Clustering of
Weighted Directed Networks*.
I am an alumnus of
[St John's College](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/).
