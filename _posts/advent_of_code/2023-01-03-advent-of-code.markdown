In 2022 I tackled Advent of Code for the first time,
using the Julia language. Here are some brief thoughts.

## General thoughts

Learned about data structures
Hardest part was usually finding the right data structure
Network algorithms were the hardest, with heuristics
Divisibility tricks
Guessing and preparing for part 2
Representing lists/ranges without allocating (day 15)
In-place vs returning functions
Copying, deepcopying and pointers
Dynamic programming
Dijkstra's algorithm -- Google trends spike Dec 12
Cellular automata
Dynamic allocation with growing arrays (day 17, 23)

## Daily comments

Day 23 was worried part 2 would take a huge amount of time but no
Day 20 just tricky indexing
