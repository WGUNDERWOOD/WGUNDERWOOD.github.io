TODO Abstract

## Introduction

TODO Controlling sup of stochastic processes is important -- examples
TODO Define subg process

## Covering numbers

TODO Define and give properties

## Dudley's theorem

TODO State result

## Sub-Gaussian chaining

TODO Use the chaining method to prove Dudley's theorem

## Examples

### Example 1: radial basis function kernel

TODO Figure: sample trajectories from RBF GP with a different scales
TODO Figure: Empirical expected supremum and Dudley's bound

### Example 2: Ornstein--Uhlenbeck kernel

TODO Figure: sample trajectories from OU GP with a different scales
TODO Figure: Empirical expected supremum and Dudley's bound
