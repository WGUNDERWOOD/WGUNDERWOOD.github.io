An update on my research and software relating to
dyadic kernel density estimation.

I'm pleased to announce that my preprint,
titled "Uniform Inference for Kernel Density Estimators with Dyadic Data"
and coauthored with
[Matias Cattaneo](https://cattaneo.princeton.edu)
and
[Yingjie Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/yingjieum/),
is now available on at
[arxiv:2201.05967](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05967)!

An implementation of our methodology is provided in the
"DyadicKDE" Julia package, available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/WGUNDERWOOD/DyadicKDE.jl).
